# Arduino 3.7 - Conditionals II
## For our final programming assignment you will use an analog sensor to control output with conditionals. 

### This assignment will use the concepst learned using `analogRead()` and control of the RGB LED from previous assignments.  The conditionals `if()`, `else if()` and `else` will be needed to solve this problem.

### Step One: Build the Circuit

Build your circuit according to this schematic:

### Step Two: Break down the process

The best way to handle a comples task is to break it into parts:
1. Make the RGB LED produce the seven colors of the rainbow (Draw on what you did in the previous assignment).
2. Read the potentiometer with `analogRead()`
3. Review how to use [`if()`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/if/) and [`else`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/else/) on the Arduino Reference.

### Step Three: Put the Code Together

Your prototype should change the color of the LED as you turn the potentiometer.  It needs to cycle through the colors of the rainbow (ROYGBIV) in order as it does.

Use the video below as a reference.

### Step Four: Debug and Submit

Make sure your prototype behaves the same way as the one in the video. As in the previous assignment, make a new file here on GitHub. Name it 3.7_Analog_Input_Control.ino and Commit it to the repository.
